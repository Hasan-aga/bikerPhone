## Development

Since this is a react-native app, you can build it for iOS (requires xcode!) and Android. To run the development server simply use `yarn start` and to start the emulator use `yarn android` or `yarn ios`.
Refer to [react-native's documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) for more details.
